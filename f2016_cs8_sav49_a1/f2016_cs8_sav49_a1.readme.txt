The intention of this program is to calculate the gas mileage consumption of a client's car dealer business. This client
has international customers, so this program should support both USC and metric systems. The program begins by asking
the user "which system he/she wants to use?". There is a logic check to make sure the user enters either USC or metric.
The next input the user would enter is the distance driven and the gasoline consumed. Based on the unit chosen, either
miles to kilometers or kilometers to miles is calculated. Likewise, gallons to liters or liters to gallons is also
calculated. After these calculations, the program will know the distance in miles, distance in kilometers, gasoline
consumed in gallons and gasoline consumed in liters. With all these data variables, the program calculates miles per
gallon and liters per hundred kilometers. Then, based on the gas consumption ranges, the gas consumption ratings are
derived. Finally, all these variables, plus the gas consumption ratings are displayed as a result.
