The program starts off by defining the processFile function. The processFile funtion takes one input parameter called
fh, which is the file name. In this function, you would open the file and read each line. When you read each line, you
will count the number of lines and add the distance for all of the lines. This function would return two output
parameters which is the number of lines in the file and the total distance of all lines.

Secondly, we define the printKV function. This function has three parameters, key, value and keylength. This function is
used for printing with the left justified key.

In the main program, the user is asked to enter the file name or type in "quit" to come out of the program. For every file
entered by the user, the processFile function is called. Then, a cummulative line count and distance count is calculated
based on the return parameters from the process file function. The printKV function is called to display the partial
file line count and total distance value for each file. When the user enters quit, then the printKV function is called
to display the cumulative line count and cumulative distance from all files.
