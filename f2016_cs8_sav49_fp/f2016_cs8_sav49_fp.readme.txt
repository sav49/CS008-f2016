The program starts off by defining the processFile function. Then the master input list file is read. The names of the
data files are then retrieved. Every line of every file is read and the all the names and distances are extracted.

In the main program, the toal distance ran by all the participants was calculated and the total distance run for each
participant was calculated. After, the maximum distance ran by an individual participant was calculated along with the
minimum distance ran by a single participant.

Then, the program reports if any participant appears more than once in a list and if so , then the number of times they
appeared was reported. And lastly the total number of participants in all three lists were calculated.
